Besides his religious activities he was active in the temperance and abolitionist movements. In the late 1850s Cheever and his younger brother, Henry, another Congregationalist minister, were the leading figures in the Church Anti-Slavery Society that attempted to coordinate abolitionist activities in evangelical denominations. During the early years of the Civil War, Cheever vociferously criticized the Lincoln administration for not embracing immediate abolition.

As a reporter for the New York Observer, he made the acquaintance of the Reverends Henry Ward Beecher and George B. Cheever, who were instrumental in his becoming, in 1856, the managing editor of the New York Independent, a popular religious journal. In the early 1860s Tilton tried to recruit Douglass as a regular contributor to the Independent and the two became friends. Tilton succeeded Beecher as editor of the Independent in 1862 and continued in that position until 1871. After the Civil War he also became a popular speaker on the topics of Radical Reconstruction and women’s rights. His public career never recovered, however, from the notoriety he attracted in 1874 as a result of an unsuccessful lawsuit charging Beecher with committing adultery with his wife. Subsequent journalistic efforts failed, and in 1883 Tilton left the United State for Europe. He eventually settled in Paris where he wrote essays and poetry to support himself. When Douglass visited Paris in 1886 Tilton served as his guide. On Douglass’s death, Tilton published Sonnets to the Memory of Frederick Douglass (Paris, 1895). ","

Montgomery Blair graduated from West Point in 1835, served in the Army, and studied law in St. Louis, Missouri. He founded his practice in 1837, was appointed U.S. district attorney for the state of Missouri, elected mayor of St. Louis, and appointed judge of the Court of Common Pleas. Politically Blair was a chameleon, but he supported the gradual emancipation of slaves and came to support the colonization of freed slaves. He represented Dred Scott in his Supreme Court case and was asked but declined to defend John Brown on charges associated with his attack on Harpers Ferry. Abraham Lincoln appointed Blair Postmaster General in 1861. Blair’s tenure in this office was vexed because he expressed strong opinions and was considered tactless. He stirred controversy when he began requiring all employees of the postal department to take oaths of loyalty, excluded from the mail delivery service all newspapers that were disloyal to the union, and organized a team of inspectors who reported disloyal postmasters. Blair is perhaps best remembered for his foundational work on the development of the Universal Postal Union that standardized the systems of weight, rates, prepayment conditions and postage collections for all international mail. He also devised a plan whereby each regiment appointed its own postmaster thus relieving the burden on many rural postal workers who were not equipped to handle the volume of correspondence. Blair successfully reduced the postal deficit by implementing reforms like the adoption of three classes of mail, standardized rates for letters, a uniform money order system, and a re-designed railway postal service. Under pressure from radical elements in Congress, Lincoln asked for Blair’s resignation. Blair cooperated, resigning his post in September 1864 after which he practiced law with his son until his death.","Rita L. Moroney, Montgomery Blair, Postmaster General (Washington, D.C., 1963).  "

In 1835, Baker opened a law office in Springfield and formed a partnership with Josephus Hewett. He also briefly had law partnerships with Stephen T. Logan and Albert T. Bledsoe. Baker's active law practice, coupled with his involvement in Whig Party politics, brought him into close association with Abraham Lincoln, who named his second son after Baker. Lincoln and Baker represented Sangamon County together in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1837 to 1840, and Baker served in the Illinois Senate from 1840 to 1843. Elected to U. S. Congress in 1845, Baker resigned his seat in 1846 to take a commission as colonel of the 4th Illinois Infantry in the Mexican War.

In November 1833, Douglas moved to Illinois, where he taught school and studied law, gaining admission to the bar in March 1834. He then settled in Jacksonville, where he began practicing law and served as state's attorney for the First Judicial Circuit from 1835 to 1836. Voters elected him as a Democrat to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1836 and, in March 1837, he moved to Springfield to become the register of the local Federal land office. Douglas became Illinois Secretary of State in November 1840 but resigned three months later. The state legislature appointed him to the Illinois Supreme Court in 1841; at the age of twenty-seven, he became the youngest person to have served on that court. During his brief tenure, Douglas was a justice in twenty-four cases Lincoln argued before the supreme court. In 1843, Douglas won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for two terms. In 1846 and again in 1853, Douglas won election to the U.S. Senate, where he became a powerful and influential national figure in the Democratic Party.

Widely knows as the ""Little Giant"" due to his small stature and dominant presence, Douglas was a champion of the doctrine of popular sovereignty and played a leading role in the Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. During the ensuing controversy over Kansas' slave status, Douglas went against the Democratic Buchanan administration by rejecting the Lecompton constitution, which led to a brief flirtation with the Republican Party and division within the Democratic Party. Nevertheless, Douglas won reelection to the U.S. Senate in 1858 over Abraham Lincoln. This heated campaign included the famous Lincoln-Douglas Debates that gave Lincoln national recognition. In 1860, Douglas ran against Lincoln for the Presidency. While Democrats in northern states generally voted for Douglas, those in southern states voted for John C. Breckinridge, splitting the Democratic vote and enabling Lincoln's electoral triumph. After the election, Douglas served on the Committee of Thirteen and supported the ill-fated Crittenden resolution in an attempt to save the Union. He voiced his support for the Lincoln administration, however, and on April 25, 1861, he delivered one of his most famous pro-Union speeches in Springfield, Illinois, at the state capitol building. He contracted typhoid fever and died shortly thereafter.

Lincoln himself settled in New Salem, Illinois, in Sangamon County, later that year. He served in the Black Hawk War in 1832 and as New Salem's postmaster from May 7, 1833 to May 30, 1836. Some of Lincoln's New Salem friends relied on him to draft legal documents, ranging from petitions to wills, and this work represented the very beginnings of his legal career. His political career also began in New Salem, where voters elected him to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1834. He remained in the Illinois House until 1842. During his first term in 1834, John T. Stuart, a friend of Lincoln’s and a fellow legislator, advised him to study law and earned admittance to the bar on September 9, 1836. 

Lincoln moved to Springfield, Illinois, in 1837. From April 12, 1837 to April 14, 1841, he was Stuart’s law partner. On April 14, 1841, he joined in a partnership with Stephen T. Logan, which lasted until December 1844. Lincoln formed his third and final partnership with William H. Herndon soon after Herndon’s admittance to the bar on December 9, 1844. Lincoln married Mary Todd on November 4, 1842, in Springfield, Illinois. Between 1843 and 1853, they had four sons, Robert, Edward, William, and Thomas. Of their four sons, only Robert lived to adulthood. 

In 1843, Lincoln failed to win the Whig Party nomination theUnited States House of Representatives for the newly created Seventh Congressional District; John J. Hardin received it instead. In 1846, Lincoln won election to the U.S. House and served from December 6, 1847 until March 3, 1849. He unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate in 1854. Although previously a firm proponent of the Whig Party, Lincoln joined the newly-created Republican Party in 1856 and ran for the United States Senate under the new banner in 1858. His opponent was the Democratic incumbent, Stephen A. Douglas, and between August 21 and October 15, 1858, they engaged in a series of seven debates throughout Illinois. Although Lincoln lost the 1858 election to Douglas, their debates brought him national recognition and set the stage for his 1860 Republican presidential nomination. In the 1860 presidential election, Lincoln defeated the two Democratic nominees, Douglas and John C. Breckinridge, along with National Union nominee John Bell, triggering the secession movement in the southern states. By the time Lincoln left Springfield for Washington, D. C., on February 11, 1861, seven states had declared independence from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America. 

Following the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, Lincoln declared the southern states to be in a state of rebellion and called for volunteers, causing four more states to secede. The ensuing Civil War lasted into the spring of 1865, when Union forces finally subdued the Confederate military. During the war, Lincoln and other northerners increasingly viewed the destruction of slavery as critical for the Union's preservation. The primary result of this was Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, and his heavy involvement in the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, which permanently abolished slavery. Lincoln ran for reelection in 1864 as a candidate for the Union Party (primarily the Republicans under a different name) against the Democratic candidate, George B. McClellan, and once again won. With the collapse of the Confederacy and the end of the war evident in April 1865, Confederate patriot and popular actor John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln at Ford's Theater on the 14th. Lincoln died the next day.

Logan received his elementary education in Frankfort before moving to Glasgow in 1817 to study law under Judge Christopher Tompkins. He was admitted to the bar at the age of twenty and was appointed Commonwealth Attorney for the Glasgow district. Logan came to Springfield, Illinois, in 1832 to continue the practice of law and formed a partnership with William L. May. He married America T. Bush in June of 1832, and their union produced eight children. In January of 1835, Logan became judge of the First Judicial Circuit and held that position until March of 1837. After resigning from the bench, Logan formed a legal partnership with Edward D. Baker, but that partnership soon ended because Logan found Baker to be reckless with money. In 1841, Abraham Lincoln became Logan’s junior law partner. This partnership lasted until 1844, when they amicably dissolved the relationship so that Logan could practice law with his son, David Logan. Active in Whig politics, Logan was elected to the Illinois legislature in 1842, 1844, and 1846, served in the Illinois constitutional convention of 1848, and was elected again to the state legislature in 1854. He was also a delegate to the Republican national nominating convention in 1860. President Lincoln appointed Logan in 1862 to a commission to investigate claims against the government in Cairo, Illinois. That same year, Logan served as a delegate to the Washington Peace Conference. Logan amassed considerable wealth during his lifetime; by 1860, he had accumulated $175,000 in real estate and owned personal property worth $70,000. He died on July 17, 1880 in Springfield.","David Herbert Donald, Lincoln (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995), 88, 96-100, 133; Sylvia B.

The group returned to St. Louis via steamship that summer; and Offutt hired Lincoln to be a clerk in the new store and sent him ahead while he stayed in St. Louis to purchase goods for the new venture. Offutt rented the mill at New Salem and in September 1831 opened the store, in which Lincoln was a clerk until the outbreak of the Black Hawk War in April 1832. According to his friends, Offutt was a good talker but not such a good businessman. After just nine months in business, Offutt fled New Salem, leaving his creditors behind him. He moved back to Kentucky to raise livestock with his family.

In 1809, Perry received another independent command and freed an American ship that had been seized by the British, making him a national celebrity. In 1811, he married Elizabeth Champlin Mason, with whom he had five children.

As the War of 1812 approached, Perry requested a new command and the Navy put him in control of Lake Erie in 1813. Perry quickly constructed a lake squadron which, under the banner ""Don't Give Up the Ship,"" defeated the British in the Battle of Lake Erie and gave the United States control of the Great Lakes. This was a highly symbolic victory, which earned Perry promotion to captain. Following the war, Perry assumed command of his own ship but his first voyage went very badly and resulted in a duel with the marine commander on board. In 1819, President James Monroe appointed Perry to a diplomatic mission to Venezuela, which Perry completed. He died en route to Trinidad.

A Democrat, Pierce won election to the New Hampshire General Court in 1829 and remained there until 1833. That year, voters elected him to the U.S. House of Representatives and then to the U.S. Senate in 1836. He resigned his Senate seat in 1842 and practiced law in Concord, New Hampshire. James K. Polk appointed him U.S. attorney for New Hampshire, and he remained in that office until enlisting in the Mexican War. During the war, Pierce rose to the rank of brigadier general, returning afterward to again resume his practice in Concord. Following a divisive Democratic National Convention in 1852, the party selected Pierce as its presidential nominee. Pierce handily defeated the Whig candidate, Winfield Scott, leading to a very conservative presidency. His primary foreign policy achievement was negotiating the Gadsden Purchase with Mexico, while his attempts to annex new territory almost entirely failed. These failures and the increasing violence in Kansas put Pierce in a poor position going into the 1856 election, and the Democrats instead selected James Buchanan as their candidate. Pierce spent much of his subsequent career traveling. He opposed Abraham Lincoln's presidential campaign and, during the Civil War, regularly spoke out against the Lincoln administration, leading some to erroneously suspect him of treason.","Larry Gara, The Presidency of Franklin Pierce (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1991); Roy Franklin Nichols, Franklin Pierce: Young Hickory of the Granite Hills (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1969); Nathaniel Hawthorne, Life of Franklin Pierce (Boston, Mass.: Ticknor, Reed and Fields, 1852)."
